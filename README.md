## Why this exists

ISO 27001 compliance work is typically scattered across spreadsheets, Word docs, ticketing systems, and shared drives. Security teams and consultants spend more time chasing evidence and reformatting documents than actually improving security posture.

**`iso27001-mcp` solves this by giving Claude a live, stateful ISMS** — all 93 ISO 27001:2022 controls seeded and ready, a real risk register, policy and procedure generators, evidence tracking, audit workflows, and a Statement of Applicability, backed by an encrypted local database that never leaves your machine.

The difference from generating static documents: Claude can *query, reason, and update* across your entire ISMS in a single conversation. Ask it to run a gap assessment, identify which open risks are linked to unimplemented controls, generate the policies that close those gaps, and produce a remediation roadmap — all without switching tools.

**Who it's for:** Security teams · Compliance consultants · GRC engineers · Startups preparing for ISO 27001 · Internal audit functions

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20.11.0+** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) / [Volta](https://volta.sh)
- **Build tools** (for the encrypted SQLite native module):
  - **macOS:** `xcode-select --install`
  - **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt-get install build-essential python3`
  - **Windows:** [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) → "Desktop development with C++"

### Three commands to get running

```bash
npm install -g iso27001-mcp   # 1. install globally
iso27001-mcp init              # 2. interactive setup — secrets, database, API key, Claude config
iso27001-mcp doctor            # 3. verify everything is working
```

After running `iso27001-mcp doctor` you should see:

```
iso27001-mcp — health check
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✅  DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY      set (64 hex chars)
✅  HMAC_SECRET            set (64 hex chars)
✅  MCP_API_KEY            set (starts with iso27001_)
✅  Database file          /Users/you/.iso27001/isms.db
✅  Database accessible    opened and queried successfully
✅  Migrations             7/7 applied
✅  Controls seeded        93 ISO 27001:2022 controls
✅  Active API key         1 active key found
✅  Claude Desktop config  /Users/you/.../claude_desktop_config.json
✅  iso27001-mcp entry     present in mcpServers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  All 10 checks passed. Restart Claude Desktop if you just ran init.
```

Then **restart Claude Desktop** (quit fully and reopen). You should see 63 tools in the tools panel.

### Five prompts to try first

```
"Use get_server_info to verify the server is running."
"Run an ISO 27001 gap assessment for a 50-person SaaS company."

### ISO 27001 Policy Templates

Generate any of these with a single Claude prompt:

`information_security` · `access_control` · `risk_management` · `asset_management` · `incident_response` · `business_continuity` · `supplier_security` · `cryptography` · `physical_security` · `acceptable_use` · `data_classification` · `secure_development`

### ISO 27001 Procedure Templates

`incident_handling` · `access_provisioning` · `asset_onboarding_offboarding` · `audit_log_review` · `backup_restore` · `bcp_testing` · `change_management` · `cryptographic_key_management` · `data_classification_handling` · `secure_development_workflow` · `supplier_onboarding` · `vulnerability_management`

### Evidence Document Templates

Pre-structured evidence documents for auditor submissions: `access_review_attestation` · `bcp_test_report` · `incident_post_mortem` · `risk_treatment_sign_off` · `supplier_security_questionnaire` · `training_acknowledgement`

### Sample Outputs

The [`samples/`](samples/) directory contains auditor-ready example outputs for a fictitious organisation ("Acme Financial Services Ltd") — a full gap assessment, remediation roadmap, risk register CSV, SoA CSV, access control policy, incident handling procedure, internal audit report, corrective action records, and evidence package. See [Sample Outputs](docs/REFERENCE.md#sample-outputs) for the full index.

| Capability | Viewer | Analyst | Admin |
|------------|--------|---------|-------|
| Read controls, clauses, version mappings | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Read gap assessments, risks, policies, audits, evidence | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create / update gap assessments and control statuses | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create and manage risks and treatment plans | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Generate policies and procedures | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create and export Statements of Applicability | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Track and link evidence artefacts | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Record and track improvement opportunities | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Plan and close internal audits; raise CARs | — | — | ✅ |
| Set organisation profile | — | — | ✅ |
| Run management reviews (Clause 9.3) | — | — | ✅ |
| View and query the audit log | — | — | ✅ |
| Generate and revoke API keys | — | — | ✅ |

**Tool counts:** Viewer — 31 tools · Analyst — 49 tools · Admin — 63 tools

### What never leaves your machine

In `local` mode (stdio, the default), no data leaves the machine. The encrypted SQLite database, the `.env` secrets file, and the append-only audit log are all stored locally. There is no telemetry, no cloud sync, and no outbound network calls — unless you explicitly configure the optional Jira or GitHub integrations.

For the full security profile — threat model, hardening guide, supply chain attestation, and audit log integrity verification — see the **[Trust Center](https://github.com/Sushegaad/MCP-Server-for-ISO27001/tree/main/docs/security/)**.

### Encryption and audit trail summary

- **Database** — AES-256 encrypted SQLite via `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers`
- **API keys** — HMAC-SHA256 hashed; raw key printed once and never stored
- **Audit log** — HMAC-SHA256 hash chain; every row linked to its predecessor — insertion, deletion, or reordering is detectable
- **Prompt injection** — free-text fields sanitised before passing to any handler

## Use Cases

### 1 — Run a Gap Assessment

Ask Claude to assess your organisation against ISO 27001:2022, track the status of each control, and generate a prioritised remediation roadmap.

> *"Create a gap assessment for Acme Ltd covering all 2022 controls. Our scope is cloud infrastructure and development. Exclude physical security controls."*

Claude will create the assessment, pre-populate all 93 controls as `not_started`, and let you work through them one by one or in bulk. When you're done:

> *"Generate a remediation roadmap grouped by risk level. Give us 26 weeks to get to certification."*

The roadmap groups work by theme (Technological first), links controls to open risks, and assigns recommended due dates.

---

### 2 — Manage the Risk Register

Track information security risks end-to-end from identification through treatment.

> *"Register a new risk: our customer database is at risk from SQL injection due to unparameterised queries. Likelihood 4, impact 5."*

> *"Create a treatment plan to mitigate this risk. Link it to controls 8.26 and 8.28. Owner: head of engineering. Due: end of Q3."*

> *"Show me all critical and high risks that still have open treatment plans."*

Risk scores are computed automatically (likelihood × impact) and reflected in summaries and heatmaps without any manual input.

---

### 3 — Generate ISMS Policies and Procedures

Generate a full suite of ISO 27001-aligned policy and procedure documents in seconds.

> *"Set our organisation profile: Acme Ltd. ISMS scope: all cloud-hosted systems and remote employees."*

> *"Generate an information security policy. Owner: CISO. Effective from 1 June 2026."*

> *"Create an Incident Handling Procedure linked to our Information Security Policy."*

Policies and procedures are rendered from Mustache templates with automatic ISO clause and control mappings. Once the organisation profile is set, `organisation_name` and `scope` are injected automatically — no need to repeat them on every call.

**12 policy types:**
`information_security` · `access_control` · `risk_management` · `asset_management` · `incident_response` · `business_continuity` · `supplier_security` · `cryptography` · `physical_security` · `acceptable_use` · `data_classification` · `secure_development`

**12 procedure types:**
`incident_handling` · `access_provisioning` · `asset_onboarding_offboarding` · `audit_log_review` · `backup_restore` · `bcp_testing` · `change_management` · `cryptographic_key_management` · `data_classification_handling` · `secure_development_workflow` · `supplier_onboarding` · `vulnerability_management`

---

### 4 — Produce a Statement of Applicability

Generate an SoA directly from your gap assessment, pre-populated with inclusion/exclusion decisions and justifications.

> *"Generate a Statement of Applicability from assessment A-001. Export it as a CSV for the auditors."*

---

### 5 — Run Internal Audits

Plan audits, record findings (NCs, observations, OFIs), raise corrective action requests, and track effectiveness.

> *"Create an audit of our access control and cryptography controls. Auditor: Jane Smith. Planned for 15 June 2026."*

> *"Record a major non-conformity against clause 9.1: no evidence of ongoing monitoring of security objectives."*

> *"Raise a CAR for this finding. Owner: compliance manager. Due in 30 days."*

The server enforces ISO 27001:2022 Clause 10.1 — a corrective action cannot be closed unless `effectiveness_verified` is `true`.

---

### 6 — Track Evidence

Register evidence artefacts for each control, spot gaps, and link them directly to Jira tickets or GitHub issues.

> *"Show me all controls marked as implemented or partial that have no current evidence."*

> *"Register a screenshot of our firewall config as evidence for control 8.20. Collector: ops team. Expires in 12 months."*

> *"Link this evidence to a new Jira ticket in the SEC project: 'Firewall config screenshot — annual review'."*

---

### 7 — Query the Audit Log

Every tool call is logged in a tamper-evident audit trail. Admins can query it at any time.

> *"Show me all tool calls made in the last 7 days that resulted in an error."*

> *"List all API keys and when they were last used."*
